# Welcome to Remote Coach

This is a side project I'm currently in the midst of building for one of my swimming friends who's remotely coaching another swimmer as she trains for a long open-water race.

## It needs node >= 6.7.0

## 3. To run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Setup

`/app` has the React/Redux setup. `main.jsx` is the entry point.

`/db` has the Sequelize models and database setup.

`/server` has the Express server and routes. `start.js` is the entry point.

`/bin` has scripts.

## Beta version

[Deployed on Heroku](http://remotecoach.herokuapp.com/)
